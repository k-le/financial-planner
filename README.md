# Budgeter - A Financial Planner
## Introduction üëãüèº
The project will focus on developing a financial budgeting web app that aims to 
help the user keep track of their money and their spending categories!
Existing inspirations for this project would be YNAB or Intuit's mint.

<b>This project is currently in development and is subject to being updated.</b>

## Features üí°
Ideally, there are certain features that we would like to implement into this project 
to both develop knowledge and also to attempt and make the app as complete as possible.

Here is a list of features that would be great to have in an ideal budgeting app:

- Adding various bank accounts and/or investment accounts
- Spending categories
- Graphs to visualize spending habits / financial data
- Recurring payments
- Cleared / uncleared charges

The list of features are only suggestions and are also tentative to change.

## Prospective Tools

### Web Application Development
[Django](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p)

Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the 
model-template-views architectural pattern. It's a high-level Python web framework 
that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Django has a 
steeper learning curve than Flask (see below), but is full-stack compared to Flask.

### Visualizing Data
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

Matplotlib is a very powerful Python tool that allows for generating and plotting 
graphs with large features of customization. This could be extremely useful for 
creating visualizing spending data!

### Databases
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

Developed at the University of California - Berkeley, PostgreSQL is open-source 
and supports a large part of the SQL standard. It's highly compliant and offers 
many modern features.
